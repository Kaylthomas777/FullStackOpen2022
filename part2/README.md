## Part 2 Communicating with server
Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

### Rendering a collection, modules
Generate React elements from arrays or objects using the map function.

### Key-attribute
#### warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop.
React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.

### Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys
We could have made the error message on our console disappear by using the array indexes as keys. The indexes can be retrieved by passing a second parameter to the callback function of the map method:

```javascript
notes.map((note, i) => ...)
```
When called like this, i is assigned the value of the index of the position in the array where the note resides.This is; however, not recommended and can create undesired problems even if it seems to be working just fine. Instead generate a unique id for every item and use it as key when rendering the list.
